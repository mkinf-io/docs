While self-service creation and customization of agent repositories is not yet available, we are actively working on implementing these features. In the meantime, you can contribute new agents by submitting your repository for integration through our review process. This allows us to ensure quality and compatibility while we develop our self-service platform.

## Key features coming soon
- Creating new agent repositories
- Forking existing agents
- Customizing agent configurations
- Direct publishing to the hub

## Submit a repository
You can submit a repository [here](https://hub.mkinf.io/agents/suggest).

## Next Steps
- Check out our [SDK repository](https://github.com/mkinf-io/mkinf-py/tree/main/example) for implementation samples
- Join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/mkinf-community/shared_invite/zt-2wa3mqqsx-27qHzCok~BCdZTowifer~g) for support
