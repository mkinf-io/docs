## Overview

You can access mkinf hub Agents throught the [mkinf python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/mkinf/) or via REST API calls.


### 1. Find an AI Agent

Browse available AI Agents at [mkinf hub](https://hub.mkinf.io/) and select an agent that matches your use case

## Python

### Import the AI Agent
To import the agents in our platform, follow this structure:

```python
from mkinf import hub as mh
tools = mh.pull(["owner/repository"])
```

Some tools require environment variables, including API keys, which must be created and set before use.

```python
from mkinf import hub as mh
tools = mh.pull(
    ["ScrapeGraphAI/scrapegraphai"],
    env={
        "SCRAPEGRAPH_LLM_MODEL": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        "SCRAPEGRAPH_LLM_API_KEY": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    },
    timeout=120
)
```
You can even set an execution timeout, the default execution timeout is **60 seconds**.

<Note>Remember to configure any required environment variables specified in the agent's documentation.</Note>

<Warning>Currently, mkinf tools are compatible with LangChain chains and graphs. Support for other frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, and SmolAgents is coming soon.</Warning>

## REST API
### Request execution
Agents actions can also be executed directly via API call.
```bash
curl -X POST "https://run.mkinf.io/v0.1/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>:<REPO_VERSION>/<REPO_ACTION>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MKINF_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "args": { "your_arg_key": "your_arg_value" },
    "env": { "your_env_key": "your_env_value" },
    "timeout": 60
  }'
```
Note that you have also to include the input arguments, you can them in the **input schema** of each action.
